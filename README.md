# Dasmotos_dev
Current code for Dasmotos site in Dev
So couple things on my work.

- This was a do it yourself project for one of the codecademy lessons. The steps were simple, so I took it a bit further and added the flex to make it responsive as well as the footer options.
- One thing I couldn't figure out... For the options on the footer, I wanted to make the entire button clickable. 
However, only when you hover over the text then it becomes a clickable option. Obviously in real scenario these options would take you to a new page, but haven't built those out yet.
